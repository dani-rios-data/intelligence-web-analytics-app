# Web Analytics App

This project is a web-based analytics platform that processes data through various microservices. Users can upload CSV or Excel files for different services and receive analytical responses.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main components:

### Microservices
The `microservices/` directory contains various API services that process the uploaded data. Each microservice is configured to:
- Accept CSV/Excel file uploads
- Process the data according to specific business rules
- Return analytical results

### Web Application
The `web/` directory contains the frontend application where users can:
- Select different types of services
- Upload data files (CSV/Excel)
- Visualize and download the processed results

## Current Status
